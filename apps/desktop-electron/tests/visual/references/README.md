# ReUI App Shell 4 reference authority

`reui-app-shell-4-2026-09-03-1280x720.png` is the active visual-composition reference for the Electron Renderer shell. The same-session capture also includes collapsed and mobile states. `reui-app-shell-4-render.json` pins checksums, computed-style and geometry observations, and acceptance boundaries. `reui-app-shell-4-dom-2026-09-03.json` contains the observed hierarchy, classes, bounds and selected computed properties of 298 rendered non-SVG shell elements; it is not original component source or a complete website export.

The historical `reui-app-shell-4-1280x720.png` from 2026-09-02 remains unchanged, with its checksum retained in the render record.

The pinned public reference continues to record a 390px context pane and x=440
content origin. Voice2Text now deliberately differs: its product context pane
defaults to 300px, is adjustable at runtime from 240px through 480px, shares one
requested width across the four main sections, and temporarily clamps without
overwriting that request when the window narrows. This product delta does not
alter the reference image, DOM evidence, geometry, or checksums. Actual rendered
product acceptance and width-sensitive golden refresh remain pending explicit
visual-validation authorization.

The image and render record govern the observed ReUI shell composition,
fixed-column geometry, density, divider placement, control placement and state
hierarchy. They are public-render evidence, not the current Voice2Text width
contract, the original ReUI React, or Registry source. Local `radix-nova`
primitives remain authoritative for component semantics, keyboard behavior,
focus and independently authored implementation.

Authenticated ReUI MCP discovery was attempted on 2026-09-03 and returned `locked: true` with `requiredPlan: pro`. The implementation therefore must not claim source access, bypass the premium Registry, decompile production bundles, copy the complete website stylesheet or hotlink ReUI runtime assets. The user explicitly approved using the observable public preview as the visual authority while implementing product behavior locally.

To replace this reference, deliberately recapture the same public preview at the desktop and responsive viewports recorded in `reui-app-shell-4-render.json`; refresh its DOM/style evidence and checksums; then inspect it side by side with the Electron `audio-app-shell-4.png` candidate before accepting any golden updates. A live-page change never silently replaces the pinned files.

The previous screenshot-led implementation plan remains available as superseded design history at `docs/plans/2026-09-02-1350-refactor-electron-reui-app-shell-plan.md`.

The Renderer self-hosts Inter Variable through the pinned `@fontsource-variable/inter` dependency. Its unmodified license is distributed from `public/licenses/inter-OFL.txt` by Vite's public asset copy. No ReUI runtime asset is used. The midpoint handle matches the observed transparent 28×48 hit area and two 2×8 strokes. Authorized direct image inspection and regional geometry/style assertions were completed on 2026-09-03 against the Electron product. Product content, Chinese fallback typography, thin focus, native handle title and desktop minimum behavior remain deliberate differences; this is not whole-page pixel equality.
